# XInput Combination Lock

Yes, you heard that right. This idea was concieved when I was bored and fidgeting with my Xbox One controller. I was rotating the right stick at its farthest point, and it reminded me of Steam's 'outer ring' and 'scrollwheel' bindings for controllers.

* The 'outer ring' binding allows events to be bound to when the stick is at its farthest point from the center.
* The 'scrollwheel' binding has an option to scroll when the stick is rotated. 
  
That gave me a very random and nonsensical idea: **I could make a combination lock with this stick!** Something really pleased me about that idea, and I wrote it down on my todo list.

## Notice

Special thanks to [thraaawn](https://github.com/thraaawn) for his amazing [xinputjs](https://github.com/thraaawn/xinputjs)! I was having trouble using [creationix's node-gamepad](https://github.com/creationix/node-gamepad) until I found his.

**For that reason, only <u>XInput based</u> controllers like the Xbox 360 and One controllers are supported.**

I will try to work on this project as much as I can in my spare time and add to it.
